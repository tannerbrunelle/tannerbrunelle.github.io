## Welcome to Tanner's website
ISAT 252
Semester Plan

1. Learn Pyhton
So far in this course I have downloaded Python. 
In the next week I plan to research and learn introductory programs. 
2. Write a "Hello, World!" code
3. Brainstorm semester projects that relate to my capstone project. 
How can programming be involved in the creation and implementation of styrofoam concrete blcoks. 
Code a calculation to figure out how much Styrofoam is needed to build a structure. 
Variables: Size of structure, size of blocks, density of blocks, styrofoam composition...
Maybe code data points to create graphs?
